Analyzing the makeup of Core instructors.

## Setup

In the `data/` folder, there are 3 files: 
* `facultyandstaff-110119.json`, exported from the directory scraper.
* `students-110119.json`, exported from the directory scraper.
* `contemporary_civilization_courses.json`, exported from the Vergil scraper.

Information from the directory is divided into `facultyandstaff` and `students`. `facultyandstaff` describe faculty and staff; `students` describe students, which includes the graduate students that teach classes.

Directory information will probably remain the same. But Vergil/courses information will frequently be added, updated, and merged, as Seyla finds more Core classes for you to analyze their instructor makeup.
